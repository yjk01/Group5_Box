-- laser-thickness = 0.001 pts = 1.388e^-5 in.
-- SO... hypothetically, laser thickness doesn't matter. Foamboard burns more than actually plywood.
-- white foamboard thickness = 1/4 in.
-- Top, Bottom = inward only
-- front, back = both end sides have to be (tab length) - (thickness of material) we're using
    -- ex) if material = 1/4 thick, 5x5x5 box, tab length = 1 in., both ends of front and back squares has to be 1 in. - 1/4 in.  = 3/4 in.
-- any usesful formula to get tab length? maybe limit number of tabs to 2 or 3?
-- or use certain percentage to determine number of tabs?

new late discoveries
-- lines that meet have some issue with smooth connection
-- they don't completely overlap
-- update) doesn't matter

phone holder
-- rectangular box for connecting charger is at face 3 of box
-- maybe use length of lowermost tab as x and 1/2 of tab 1 to 1/2 tab 2 as y of the rect. 
-- Dr. Reeves phone = Google pixel 3a (6.0 x 2.80 x 0.30 in)
-- Iphone 11(5.94x2.98x0.33 in)
-- Insert box should be 3~4in x 0.5 in
-- cant find any popular phones thicker than 0.5 in
-- charger thickness = 1/8 ~ 1/4 inch
